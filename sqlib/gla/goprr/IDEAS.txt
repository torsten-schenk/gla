note:
- each role with the same attribute combination exists just once per graph

indexing:
- storage: add new column type MultiColumn, which can contain an arbitrary number of entries. Just one allowed in key columns and one in value columns.
- indexing: create an index table [ relationship, <multicolumn with selectable (defined in index definition, order relevant) properties of role/object> ] -> [ role, object ]
